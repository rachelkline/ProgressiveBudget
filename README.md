## Description

  *The what, why, and how:*

`PROJECT DESCRIPTION:` We were given some starter code (including pre-built HTML and some Javascript) and tasked with making the application functional when offline. I had to add functionality to the existing Budget Tracker application to allow for offline access and functionality.

The user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. When entering transactions offline, they should populate the total when brought back online.

Offline Functionality:

  * Enter deposits offline

  * Enter expenses offline

When brought back online:

  * Offline entries should be added to tracker.


`WHAT IS IT FOR?:` Giving users a fast and easy way to track their money is important, but allowing them to access that information anytime is even more important. Having offline functionality is paramount to our applications success.
